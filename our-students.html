          <h2>OUR STUDENTS.</h2>
          <p>
            Our Students are divided in to two sectors' the Technical Students and the Business Students.
          </p>
           <p>
        Our students are at the core of everything we do and we know that student life is an integral part of their development. We are committed to ensuring that we nurture, develop, challenge and motivate all of our students to be the best that they can be. We have student alumni association that create platform for students to socialize, discuss and work collaboratively on life changing skills and community based projects such as debate, drama, radio programs, mentorship programs, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no limit to the personal achievement that our students can’t reach. We are constantly challenging them to reach and exceed their aspirations professionally, socially, physically and through their creativity. The Institute also has its own ways of celebrating our students’ excellence during our graduation celebration week in a form of organizing pool party in one of the reputable hotels in the Gambia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our rich and fulfilling school life provides many opportunities for our students to achieve at the highest levels, as well as grow and develop in personal and social confidence.
        We are sure that our graduates will look back with great affection to their time at GTTI, and will agree that their experience at GTTI has been career- and life-enhancing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many will have made lifelong friends, and all have memories that will last a lifetime. We congratulate all our graduates on their achievements, and wish them every success for the future.
