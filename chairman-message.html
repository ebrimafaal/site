          <h2>Chairman's Message.</h2>
          
          <p>
           <p>As the Gambia Technical Training Institute (GTTI) continues to work towards the realization of the Government’s development blueprint, the Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE), the presentation of this year’s institutional report highlights some of the challenges encountered during the year under review.  One important part of its strategic plan is a programme reappraisal to intensify its implementation of Vision 2016 in its core curricula.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, GTTI continues to plan and implement programmes in anticipation of the tertiary integration process. Among the challenges one that stood out most was capacity building especially in the technical areas which is at the core of the institute’s mandate.  Some strides are being made to address this issue as the first batch of staff undergoing training at HND levels would be completing this year.  Consequently, the Board shall continue to monitor the implementation of programmes and ensure that there is marked improvement in the service delivery of the institute at all times.</p>
<p>The Board of Governors would like to extend its profound gratitude to the Government of the Republic of the Gambia through the Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology for the continuous support in the provision of the much needed subvention.  However, the subvention has not been increasing over the years resulting in the institute’s limitations for expansion.  As reported last year further growth will only be possible to be sustained if the subvention budget is increased to match the corresponding increase in staff and student size together with the institute’s expansion into the rural areas to minimize the rural urban drift.</p>

<p>
The successes registered during the period under review could not have been achieved without using strict measures on the judicious use of resources and a cost effective, reliable delivery system. We are most grateful to our numerous friends and partners who have given support and continue to be invaluable assets to the Institute.  In particular, special thanks go to our line ministry – the Permanent Secretary and staff of the Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, the Honourable Minister of Basic and Secondary Education and her staff, our  International and Local partners alike. We commend the Social Development Fund for the support it continues to render in the acquisition of skills by girls in male dominant courses.</p>
<p>My sincere gratitude is also extended to my colleague members of the Board of Governors, the Director General, her Management Team, Staff and all Students of the Gambia Technical Training Institute for their tremendous commitment to the realization of the institute’s objectives.</p>
